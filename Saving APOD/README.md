Saving Apod

This app is set up to pull NASA's picture of the day upon entering in the app with the discription of the picture.

The star at the top of the app will add the pictures to a favorite cell view controller that will prompt an alert view when succesfully saving. 

This can be accessed by clicking the Favorites button.

You can also view previous Apod days by selecting Choose date and using the date scroll wheel to select dates.
