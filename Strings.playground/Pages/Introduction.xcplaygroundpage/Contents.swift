Reflect
While this lesson explores Swift strings in-depth, this is not the first time you've encountered this data type. What techniques have you learned about working with strings so far?

 Your reflection
 Strings are capable of holding many things, from letter, numbers and symbols.
 Things to think about
 Thanks for sharing! Here are some ways we've used string so far.

 Interpolation - we can insert values into strings when using print() to produce readable output.
 Concatenation - we can add strings together to produce a combined string
 Loops - we can get each individual character in a string using for in syntax (e.g. for c in someString)
